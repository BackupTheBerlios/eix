# ChangeLog for eix - Ebuild IndeX for portage

*eix-0.9.4
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Print overlay from which a version was installed.
	- Try to mark versions as "installed" only for appropriate overlay.

*eix-0.9.3
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Fix nonexistent asprintf and broken FNM_CASEFOLD handling
	  for solaris, see http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173763
	- Fix manpage typo --update:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174489
	- Fix some missing include unistd.h (required for linux 2.4), see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174697
	- Use extended path for functions.sh to work with baselayout-2.
	  Thanks to Matthias Schwarzott for pointing out.

*eix-0.9.2
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Fix partly http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169127
	  (compilation error on big-endian architectures).
	- Fix std::unique which is presumably broken on some systems.
	  Perhaps this fixes the above issues completely.
	- Reformulate security recommendations in update-eix-remote. Thanks to
	  Marijn Schouten, see http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169806
	- Fix nocolor output. Thanks to Rick Morra for reporting
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170868
	- Fix compilation issues with gcc-3.3.6.
	  Thanks to Helmut Auer <helmut@helmutauer.de>
	- Minor compatibility fixes.

*eix-0.9.1
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Use environment's EPREFIX to find /etc/eixrc if
	  PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT is unset.
	- New ./configure options allow customization of default values for
	  EPREFIX and ROOT.
	- Introduce prefix-string-type for variables to make e.g. ROOT=/
	  equivalent to ROOT=''.

*eix-0.9.0
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Let * and ~* in /etc/portage/package.keywords accept stable
	  and testing keyword, respectively, of any architecture.
	  Moreover, consider this as weaker (preferrable) than ** and
	  (the soon obsolete) -*.
	- Introduce corresponding TAG_FOR_{EX_,}ALIEN_{UN,}STABLE.
	- Introduce --print option and use it in the scripts to have
	  consistent variable treatment throughout.
	- Introduce ROOT and EPREFIX_* fine granulation, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167961
	- Introduce EIXRC and EIXRC_SOURCE
	- Introduce EIX_CACHEFILE
	- Let -ARCH in /etc/portage/package.keywords stabilize -ARCH keyword.
	- Change default for TAG_FOR_{EX_,}{MINUS_ASTERISK,MISSING_KEYWORD}.
	- Drop {EX_,}TAG_FOR_STRANGE.
	- Fix memory leak in PortageUserConfig::setStability().
	- Fix some rare exceptional cases in redundancy testing of
	  /etc/portage/package.keywords and in marking of keywords.
	- Improve documentation for -I.
	- Let KEEP_VIRTUALS default to false since it confused too many people.
	  Moreover, it is somewhat dangerous if (falsely) used with
	  EPREFIX and friends.
	- Code cleanup (new-style casts and other pedantic compiler warnings).

*eix-0.8.8
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Change to new version number scheme:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165414
	- Fix sorting of things like _p20060716 (longer numbers)
	- Increase some quantities to 64bit (e.g. 20071042308
	  should still be a valid version number), or to  16bit (e.g. -r9999).
	- Internal cleanup: Proper variable typing.

*eix-0.8.7
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Let ** in /etc/portage/package.keywords accept "missing keyword".
	  This corresponds to the change in portage-2.1.2-r4, see
	  comments #20 #24 in http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160519
	- Let PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT modify the path of /etc/eixrc.
	- Allow PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT also in /etc/eixrc and ~/.eixrc
	  if not set in the environment.
	- Introduce EPREFIX which is similar to PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT but
	  applies for all paths except /usr/bin/update-eix-function.sh,
	  $HOME/eixrc, PORTAGE_PROFILE, PORTDIR, overlay paths,
	  and the cachefile arguments on the command line.
	  This allows support for prefix-portage.
	- Introduce EPREFIX_PORTAGE which is used as prefix for
	  PORTAGE_PROFILE, PORTDIR, and overlay paths.
	- Use true (soft-link resolved) filenames for PORTDIR and overlays.
	- Bugfix: Apply package.mask of profiles. This fixes
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164695

*eix-0.8.6
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Ignore *~ files in /etc/portage/package.*
	  This reflects the change of portage-2.1.2_rc4-r9 of
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144445
	- Fix <availableversionsshort>.
	- Security improvement: Use random temporary names also on systems
	  without mktemp (in eix-sync and update-eix-remote).
	- Add Push and NormalizeNames to update-eix-functions.sh
	- Code cleanup of scripts, in particular of eix-sync
	- Correct EIX_WIKI to http://eix.sourceforge.net

*eix-0.8.5
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Honour PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT
	- Honour PORTAGE_PROFILE
	- Allow environment to override/add to portage config variables
	  like PORTDIR, PORTDIR_OVERLAY, ...
	- Introduce --cache-file
	- Rename cache methods flat/backport to portage-2.0/portage-2.1
	- Experimental portage-2.1* cache method (don't use it!).
	- Prepare database format for perhaps future per-version IUSE data.

*eix-0.8.4
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Treat empty regular expression manually. This fixes
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158222
	- Add option -O to update-eix-remote, see the discussion starting at
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-278819-start-343.html
	- Add option -W and more general options -c, -C, -M to eix-sync, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159005

*eix-0.8.3
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Fix default FORMAT_HEADER_DELETE (reset color in [D]).
	- Add update-eix-layman
	- Add update-eix-functions.sh
	- Store IUSE in database (currently only for packages).
	- Add option -U (suggested by stephan.ritscher).

*eix-0.8.2
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Add options --in-overlay, --only-in-overlay
	- Add options -J, --installed-in-overlay
	- Allow wildcard patterns for overlays in --exclude-overlay and
	  --override-method (and for the corresponding variables) and
	  for the overlay references in cache method eix/eix*
	- Bugfix: Treat lines with identical target in
	  /etc/portage/package.keywords in the way portage does it
	  (i.e. ignore earlier lines if target is completely identical).
	- Introduce REDUNDANT_IF_DOUBLE_LINES (related to previous bugfix).
	- Some code cleanup and fixing of some compiler warnings.
	  Thanks to KIMURA Masaru / hiyuh <hiyuh.root@gmail.com>
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155160

*eix-0.8.1
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Conditional blocks in delayed references.
	- Make use of conditionals in defaults:
	  Introduce delayed PRINT_ALWAYS, DIFF_PRINT_INSTALLED.
	  In particular, PRINT_ALWAYS finally is a way to have a "short"
	  configuration for cyberpatrols wish to print lines even if unused:
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-278819-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-292.html
	- Let eix-sync print the time emerge --sync needed.
	- Bugfix: Let "%%{" work as documented in the treatment of
	  delayed variables.
	- Bugfix: Reset colors after each printed version.
	- Bugfix in defaults: color of marked versions/packages.
	- Tiny bugfix in defaults: color of ":" after installed version
	- Fix some comments of variables.

*eix-0.8.0
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Major change: delayed reference %{VAR} of config vars possible.
	  This way, *FORMAT_* strings can be input/modified more conveniently.
	  Moreover, most DIFF_* variables were dropped, since the distinction
	  whether eix or diff-eix is run can be made with %{*VAR}.
	  Default *FORMAT* strings make now heavy use of these delayed
	  references. In particular, all colors/strings/characters/lines are
	  stored in separate variables and can such be easily customized.
	- Introduce TAG_FOR_* variables (in particular, it is now possible
	  to completely revert to the old behaviour by setting the
	  TAG_FOR_EX_* variables empty and TAG_FOR_LOCALLY_MASKED="[M]").
	- Enable escaping of ':' in the installedversions* string arguments.
	- Bugfix: Put DIFF_NEW_SLOTS into defaults.cc
	- Fix installation date in default FORMAT_COMPACT (the separating "@"
	  was mistakenly removed in the previous release).
	- Do not include braces in default FORMAT_*INSTALL*:
	  This is better put into the installedversions* string arguments.
	- Change FORMAT_VERBOSE default to let installedversions* display
	  everything in a separate line.
	- Tiny bugfix: "and" for "Upgrade and Downgrade" in default color.

*eix-0.7.9
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Since this version, it is now strongly recommended to leave
	  *LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=true, because the "default" stability
	  can now be seen anyway: The output and default coloring was changed
	  to reflect the non-local settings (concerning the coloring, this
	  new feature is optional and can be switched off, see below).
	- Print output such that also the default (non-local) stability
	  can be seen. This is a suggestion of STEDevil, see
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-278819-start-325.html
	- Show the keyword flag also for masked versions.
	- Color according to original settings not to local settings;
	  make a possible exception for local masking (*COLOR_LOCAL_MASK).
	- Introduce *COLOR_ORIGINAL to allow the user to retain the
	  old coloring behaviour.
	- Allow 4 further strings for installedversions* to make it possible
	  to have different coloring for set/unset useflags.
	- Corresponding changes in default FORMAT strings.
	- Sort useflags alphabetically.
	- Fix a misleading text in eix-test-obsolete.
	- Fix manpage typos.

*eix-0.7.8
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Main changes are improved possibilities of (colorized!) output of
	  installed versions and corresponding changes in FORMAT_* defaults.
	- Show installed versions in FORMAT_COMPACT default.
	- Change output of marked packages/versions in FORMAT_* defaults
	  consistently to (red,1;underlined).
	- Introduce installedversionsshort, installedversionsdate,
	  installedversionsshortdate, and FORMAT_SHORT_INSTALLATION_DATE.
	- Remove DIFF_FORMAT_INSTALL* as this should better be handled in
	  the FORMAT_* strings (which is now possible also for the date).
	- Allow appending stringlist to installedversion* to influence the
	  color output.
	- Make default colors of [I],* reverse, since the only other
	  consistent choice would be to use [I] color for installed versions;
	  this looked bad since bright default was reserved for package names
	  and all other non-reserved choices remind of the "downgrade" color.
	  Change [N] color with -c correspondingly to allow better optical
	  distinction (not in diff-eix: [N] has a different meaning there).
	- Bugfix: Initialize empty search string in constructor of regex.
	  This fixes http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151327
	- Bugfix: No splitting of short options when they are option
	  parameters, e.g. in "update-eix -o -oo" the second argument
	  is not interpreted as two options of type -o.
	- Option parameters can follow without space. For instance,
	  instead of "update-eix -o test" you can use "update-eix -otest".

*eix-0.7.7
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Fix default DIFF_FORMAT_DELETE (fix "unknown property: old*" errors).
	- Introduce FORMAT_INSTALLATION_DATE and DIFF_FORMAT_INSTALLATION_DATE.
	- Introduce FORMAT_INSTALLED_USE and DIFF_FORMAT_INSTALLED_USE.
	- Reformulate description of cache methods on manpage.
	- Internal Change: Use InstVersion (inherited from BasicVersion) to
	  manage installed versions (to store e.g. installation dates).

*eix-0.7.6
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Early release to fix two problems:
	- In the default setting -T had false non-matches (the +/- prefix
	  in REDUNDANT_IF_* had falsely an effect also for some other tests).
	- The structure in the remote overlays database was changed.
	  To be more independent of such changes, update-eix-remote now
	  takes more care about filenames and adds all overlays of the
	  fetched data (although currently this adds a package too much).
	- Add eix-test-obsolete script to give a structured eix -tTc output.
	- Introduce REDUNDANT_IF_DOUBLE_{USE,CFLAGS}.
	- Fix manpage typo (thanks to Mathieu Bonnet).

*eix-0.7.5
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- By the new default, now all matches of /etc/portage/package.*
	  to non-installed packages are considered as redundant.
	  Also /etc/portage/package.cflags is now checked for redundancy
	  to the same extent as /etc/portage/package.use.
	  This was possible with the following three additions:
	- Introduce REDUNDANT_IF_IN_* to match any entry in
	  /etc/portage/package.*.
	- Introduce +/- prefix for string in REDUNDANT* to test the redundancy
	  only for installed/uninstalled packages.
	- Extend -t to contain also /etc/portage/package.cflags.
	- Let diff-eix by default list all versions if no stable exists.
	- Enable default options for eix-sync (by config-file and environment).
	- Fix eix-sync -s.
	- Let eix-sync -u imply -s "".
	- Let eix-sync not call update-eix if this was done in an emerge hook.
	- Fix tempfile handling of eix-sync if mktemp does not exist.

*eix-0.7.4
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Add support for sqlite if portage uses the sqlite backend
	    http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_speed_up_portage_with_sqlite
	  Introduce very fast cache method "sqlite" which is available if
	  eix is compiled with ./configure --with-sqlite
	- Fix endless loop and wrong sanitize in update-eix-remote.
	  Thanks to Stefan Schweizer <genstef@gentoo.org> for the report.
	- Allow different server/client PORTDIR directory for eix-sync.
	- Introduce --dump-defaults and fix output of --dump so that
	  commented variables containing newlines are commented in each line.
	- Improve error-handling of update-eix (continue as far as possible).

*eix-0.7.3
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Improved determination of "virtual" overlays.
	- Introduce KEEP_VIRTUAL and let it default to true.
	- Introduce CACHE_METHOD and ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD
	  and change override-order:
	  CACHE_METHOD < ADD_CACHE_METHOD < KEEP_VIRTUAL <
	  OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD < ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD
	- Let update-eix-remote default to temporary files:
	  With KEEP_VIRTUAL, a "permanent" remote cache is not really needed.
	- Drop permissions for update-eix-remote when fetching.
	- Enable much more customization for eix-sync:
	  rsync from/to other hosts, various hooks, keep old database.
	  Allow almost each step (gensync/emerge --sync/update-eix/...)
	  switched on/off by options.
	- Rename /etc/eix-sync-overlays to /etc/eix-sync.conf,
	  since now hooks etc. are possible in this file.
	- Document update-eix-remote and new details of eix-sync in manpage.
	- It makes now also sense to start eix-sync as a normal user (e.g.
	  for -d or certain other tasks) -> change to normal bin-directory.
	- Better doxygen sourcecode documentation.

*eix-0.7.2
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- urgent version bump to fix a segfault of update-eix -m
	  when ADD_CACHE_METHOD and OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD are both empty
	  (this happened for update-eix-remote if no configuration was used).

*eix-0.7.1
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Let cache method "none" substitute variables;
	  fix segfault in substitutions for cases like A=${X-$ARCH}
	- Previous cache method "none" is now called "none*".
	- Define standard ebuild standard variables like $P or $PN;
	- Add cache methods "ebuild" and "ebuild*" to scan properly e.g.
	  SLOTS of typical kde-base packages.
	- Better treatment of overlay eclass (in particular for ebuild*).
	- Let none, none*, ebuild, ebuild* continue after errors.
	- Add option --output to updatedb - can now run with minor permissions.
	- Improved handling of database file permissions.
	- Improved option parsing.
	- Added --override_method option; eliminated ADD_LOCAL_CACHE_METHOD.
	- Avoid memory leak in pushback_files().

*eix-0.7.0_beta
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Major changes: remote support and full support for slots.
	  For the former, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144200
	  the idea for the latter is due to a discussion with caster@matfyz.cz
	  All changes in detail:
	- Add OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD, ADD_LOCAL_CACHE_METHOD, ADD_CACHE_METHOD
	  to allow e.g. cache method metadata for a specific overlay.
	- Add cache method eix to use "pre-indexed" data for a
	  specific overlay.
	- Add cache method eix* to use "pre-indexed" data even with possibly
	  new categories.
	- Make eix database format architecture-independent.
	- Detect overlays with equivalent paths as identical.
	- Introduce COLOR_VIRTUALKEY
	- Add update-eix-remote.
	- Distinguish old/new overlays in diff-eix.
	- Fix manpage bug: best=bestlong.
	- Introduce COLOR_SLOTS, *COLORED_SLOTS, *COLON_SLOTS
	- Introduce --versionsorted, STYLE_VERSION_SORTED.
	  Let the defaults be false -> different default output.
	- Introduce bestversions* format.
	- diff-eix outputs package also if best versions change in some slot.
	- Implement -u option.
	- Introduce UPGRADE_ALWAYS_LOCAL.
	- Introduce DIFF_ONLY_INSTALLED, DIFF_NO_SLOTS.
	- Introduce formats old* and new* for DIFF_FORMAT_CHANGED.
	- Introduce formats *better, *worse, *differ for DIFF_FORMAT_CHANGED.
	- Introduce formats *upgrade, *upgradeorinstall, *downgrade,
	  *recommend, *recommendorinstall to visualize upgrade recommendations.
	- Change default formatstrings to use new features.
	- Introduce UPGRADE_ALWAYS_LOCAL, RECOMMEND_ALWAYS_LOCAL.
	- Introduce UPGRADE_TO_HIGHEST_SLOT.
	- Introduce DEFAULT_FORMAT.
	- Implement just-in-time reading of slots of installed versions.
	- Implement --quick, --care. Introduce *QUICKMODE, *CAREMODE
	- Implement --quiet for diff-eix. Introduce *QUIETMODE.

*eix-0.6.4
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Introduce slot support.
	- Fix memory leak for source command in varsreader.
	- Fix setting of package flags in all cache methods
	  (required splitting of addVersion into two functions).
	- Introduce PRINT_SLOTS and DIFF_PRINT_SLOTS.
	- Introduce options -i, -1, -2, -O.
	- Output nonexistent installed package names with -t.
	- DEFAULT_IS_OR defaults to "false" again.

*eix-0.6.3
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Rename EMPTY_IS_BAD -> TEST_FOR_EMPTY.
	  Sorry for that: eix-0.6.2 was not yet intended to be released.
	  (The release happened only by a misunderstanding).
	- Do no install test-programs.
	- Introduce PRINT_COUNT_ALWAYS.
	- Introduce TEST_FOR_NONEXISTENT, NONEXISTENT_IF_MASKED.
	- Introduce TEST_FOR_REDUNDANCY.

*eix-0.6.2
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Correct scandir handling according to ./configure in pushback_files.
	- Introduce EMPTY_IS_BAD and corresponding test in -t.

*eix-0.6.1
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Reflect portage's change of ignoring hidden files/dirs
	  for recursive reading, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137607
	- Reflect portage's behaviour of reading files/dirs in sorted order
	  for recursive reading.
	- Introduce OVERLAYS_LIST to display only overlays that are
	  really needed.
	- Option --pipe to parse output from emerge -pv (similar to genlop -p)
	- Introduce DEFAULT_IS_OR and let it default to "true".
	  This changes the default behaviour when several arguments are given.
	- Document that variables may be overridden by environment
	- Introduce -d and DUP_*_ONLY_OVERLAYS, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142469
	- Read profile/package.mask of overlays, see
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142503
	- Mark packages and versions passed with --pipe, see the discussion in
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142469
	- Introduce "marked" format and "MARK_VERSIONS" to customize the
	  marking of packages and versions passed with --pipe.
	- Change color format to allow also e.g. "underline" in the formats.
	- Change --dump to display current variables (but still defaults).
	- Introduce "markedversions" format.

*eix-0.6.0_beta
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- Implemented -T to help cleaning up /etc/portage/package.*.
	- Read package information for the newest available versions:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138629
	- Let diff-eix respect local setting (DIFF_LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG):
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140555
	- Document that it is possible to exclude the PORTDIR "overlay".
	- Add --add-overlay (ADD_OVERLAY variable) to update-eix.
	- Fixed passing of recursive flag for /etc/portage/package.*
	  This should fix http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141818
	- Treat also non-arch Keywords, e.g. x86 on an amd64 architecture.
	  To avoid increasing database size by factor ~1.5 for this feature,
	  you can use the new SMALL_EIX_DATABASE variable.
	- Introduced REDUNDANT_* to allow high customization for -T
	- Implemented -t to help further in cleaning up /etc/portage/package.*

*eix-0.5.6
	Martin Väth <vaeth at mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>:
	- If /etc/portage/package.* is a directory, read it recursively:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137784
	- patch from caster@matfyz.cz to treat version numbers as long ints:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133732
	- Support a "source " (and ". ") command in /etc/make.*:
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132874
	- Mark installed versions in output list. This experimental feature
	  can be disabled with MARK_INSTALLED=none in /etc/eixrc
	- Fixing -D again.

*eix-0.5.5
	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fix fstream.ignore-stuff in metadata and flat.
	- Redone a part of argsreader.h Option .. looks *much* cleaner now.
	- Fixed http://gentooexperimental.org/eix/ticket/3
	  (was previously http://dev.croup.de/proj/eix/ticket/3)
	  profiles can contain profiles/categories
	- fuzzy-search is now ignore-case.

*eix-0.5.4

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Introducing eix::ptr_list and eix::ptr_iterator.
	- Cleaning headers: no using namespace.

*eix-0.5.3

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Added metadata as cache-method.
	- Added a workaround for http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114628
	  Looks like the problems isn't eix, but some part of the toolchain.

*eix-0.5.1

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed trim/rtrim/ltrim: strings that only contain trim-characters are
	  cleared now. This fixes all the 'Unable to split mask "" ..' bugs.
	- portage-2.1 introduced big changes to the depcache-handling, the old
	  cache is no longer removed. Old entries are not removed. But update-eix
	  needs the cache to be ok, thus eix-sync removes the old depcache in
	  /var/cache/edb/dep.
	- More verbose output if problems with files in /etc/portage/ or the
	  profile pop up.
	  This should stop reports like http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116592
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117407 and removed a
	  compilation-error for -pedantic -ansi -W -Wall -Werror
	- Moved the code in ExplodeAtom from regex to short, _fast_ and hand-written
	  parser-code.
	- Added a compare(..) method to basicversion. This compare-method is used
	  in all other comparators, thus decreasing LOC and a bit more efficient.
	- Rewrote big parts of Mask; Be more verbose about parse-errors; Correctly
	  parse wildcard-stuff; Remove regular-expression stuff;
	- Default cache for PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD can be chosen by
	  configure-parameter.

*eix-0.5

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed a small bug regarding -o/-a and atoms with a pattern .. thanks to
	  leonie for bringing this to my attention.
	- Added PROVIDE; bumped db-version
	- Fixing http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111927
	- Added our own strndup-implementation that will be used for ppc-macos
	  See http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111912
	- Finally, environment variables can be used to override eixrc-stuff.
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111865, thanks JeR
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112776
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112806
	- Applied patches for scandir, sed, byteorder and regex from
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111912
	- Fixed some small memory-leaks - valgrind reports one more that leads
	  into the glibc (getpwnam) .. but this is really a leak. See
	  --run-glibc-freeres in valgrind(1).
	- Rewrite BasicVersion (much more efficient) and fixes
	  http://gentooexperimental.org/eix/ticket/1
	  (was previously http://dev.croup.de/proj/eix/ticket/1)
	- Fix http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113735

*eix-0.5_beta

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Formatstring(Conditions): If a "else" was missing, the if-true part was
	  linked to if-false.
	- Changed the arch-part of the dbheader from char[16] to string.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104083 - once again:
	  unsigned int vs. vector::size_type
	- Moved from #define in basicio.h to a namespace io with generic
	  read/write-functions for POD and {read,write}_string for strings.
	  Slowly moving other read/write-code into that namespace.
	- Bumped to 0.3.1
	- eix-sync hides output of emerge --sync and update-eix per default. Added
	  cli-options -v, -h, -q
	- Fixed a non-existing bug :) http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97462
	- Fixed a rather *extrem* bug: The read-only-what-we-need-to-check-if-the-package-matches
	  wasn't used at all! This brings an extrem speedup.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105935
	- I just love auto_ptr!

*eix-0.3.0

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Moved explodeShit(..) into a class with static members. Changed
	  RegExClass to Regex and changed some internals. Category was merged into
	  PackageDatabase. Removed 'this->' and ; after methods.
	- After having a nice talk with Kyuu, I added
	  LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=true/false to eixrc. It's possible to tell eix to
	  ignore all local configuration like /etc/portage and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.
	  Yes, I know that this could be done by a alias in $SHELL.
	- Fixed (think) http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103836. offset_type wasn't
	  off_t everywhere.

*eix-0.3.0_beta
*eix-0.2.7

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- PortageInstalledPackages now catches a exception thrown by BasicVersion
	  and prints the message rather then dying. For example, lockfiles in
	  /var/db/pkg are no longer lethal for eix.
	- Did the same to Mask parsing (don't die, but print an error)
	- Added target and gcc-version to the output of both, eix -V and
	  update-eix -V.
	- Fixed a bug in the cdb-code: munmap was called for bad pointers.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97914 (Thanks to
	  David Held <andukar@andukar.org> for the patch.
	- Fixed compilation-problems http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98218.
	  Patch by Cyrille Mescam <titi@oboulo.com>.
	- Masks like '>app-portage/eix-0.2*' are finally accepted by update-eix.
	- Finally changed our formatstring-code! We are no longer parsing the
	  string every time we need to print something. It's now parsed into a
	  list of structs which is much faster processed.
	- Fixed compile-errors about undefined flags from varsreader once and for all!
	- Started working on diff-eix (part of our 'esync' functionality)
	- More progress with diff-eix - currently WIP (work in progress)
	- Added IF-ELSE-FI constructs to the formatstrings (this could be the
	  final state of my featuritis ..)
	- Rewrote our stability-calculation-thingy, KEYWORDS="-* ~ARCH" is now
	  reported as TESTING (yellow color)
	- Read /etc/portage/package.{unmask,mask} on-the-fly
	- Honour ACCEPT_KEYWORDS correctly and started working on code for
	  package.keywords
	- Finished package.keywords code and basic diff-eix stuff.
	- Added sbin-script eix-sync. It's our esync!

*eix-0.2.6

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed an old bug in our parameter-parsing. The first flag after an
	  implicit OR was ignored.

*eix-0.2.5

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88148
	- Committed reviewed manpage (Thanks Legoguy)
	- Overlay reading: Check result of explodePkgFilename before using it
	- Added --version/-V options
	- Added patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89376
	  by Mike Gardiner <obz@gentoo.org>
	- Rewrote big parts of update-eix. We now have different classes for
	  different portage cache-backends.
	- Added a more descriptive section about ~/.eirx to the manpage.

*eix-0.2.2 (2005/03/26)

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Applied patch: gentoo releases == 0 now are accepted & changed metadata
	  cache directory to /var/cache/edb/dep/$PORTDIR

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Made the fsm recognize references to variables in declarations .. i.e.
	  USE="${USE} -kde".  This is important for proper make.conf/make.defaults
	  parsing.
	- Created CascadingProfile as a subclass of PortageSettings
	- Added maskings from profile
	- Added system-profile-stuff (somewhat depends on virtual/ packages ..)
	- Removed split of category into rootcat-subcat
	- And some other pretty radical changes
	- Rewrote args.cc (OOP'ish :) and added bash-completion
	- User root no longer needed to update database
	- Moved some functionality into separate toolkits.
	- Added ~-operator to class Mask

*eix-0.2.1 (2005/02/24)

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Removed deprecated Constructor from ExBasic and changed all calls
	- Removed big ugly patternmachting from portagedb.cc and moved to
	  criteria.cc (now even more ugly :) -- added wildcards.cc for wildcards-matching.
	- Moved DBQuery from portagedb.cc to filedb.cc
	- Moved PortageInstalledPackages to portageconf.cc and made it pseudo-caching
	- Removed getopt-stuff from main.cc -- this is now recursively done in
	  criteria.cc (with help from args.cc )
	- Various other small cleanups/fixes ..
	- Added --dump, --quiet and --dup-versions; Use xororand formatstring.cc
	  for output of results

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added a wiki: http://eixwiki.unfoog.de
	- Added parameter -l,--lineversions for printing versions line-by-line
	  like "etcat -v"
	- Added format strings to allow customized output. See manpage and
	  http://eixwiki.unfoog.de/index.php/Usage#Format_strings
	- Yet another 'version number sorting'-fix. Now: 1.2a < 1.2b
	- Moved Portage settings parts from PortageDB to new class PortageSettings

*eix-0.2.0

	Beholders_Eye (Gentoo Forums)
	- Fixed two warnings

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed various bugs

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- 'eix -u' crashed when it met files like abc.ebuild.xyz in overlay
	  package directories. This has been fixed.

*eix-0.2.0_beta (2005/02/12)

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed a reported bug in version.cc: Some package versions were omitted
	  in eix-0.2.0_alpha and probably in earlier versions too. Example: A
	  package with 2.1 and 2.1.1 only showed 2.1.
	- Fixed a small issue with handling files like "abc.ebuild.xyz" in portage
	  overlay directories

	Kay Ramon "YakS" Sauter <yaks-gentoo at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added man page

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Included minor fixes from Christian Heim <christian.th.heim at gmx.de>
	- Big cleanups in readoverlay to fix 2 major bugs
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80241 and
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?p=2005152#2005152
	- Added -I to search only installed packages. If no search pattern is
	  given it prints all installed packages.
	- Changed version.cc, added a test for version.cc, added 'keys' for
	  packages/versions from overlays and moved cleaned some classes(moved
	  attributes to private/protected).

*eix-0.2.0_alpha (2005/02/01)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed a "versions reported twice"-bug
	- Added --fuzzy search option to allow unsharp search queries (no regular
	  expressions).
	- Closed memory leaks
	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Constructed a FSM (finite state machine) to replace the regex-massacre
	  in varsreader.cc.
	- Fixed the "-S does not search the name, just the description"-bug and
	  added warnings if keyUndefined occurs while updating the db
	- Rewrote package::getStability(..) so it can distinguish between ppc and
	  ppc64, x86 and x86-obsd .. and so on
	- Converted the db-read/write code to use c-style FILE*, fread, fwrite. This fixes
	  the ppc-problem described in http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?p=2036103#2036103
	  Thanks meyerm for testing :)
	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed: packages with ebuilds in multiple overlays are no longer reported twice
	- Increased loading speed of the database
	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Various updates to autoconf-stuff including --with-cachefile=FILE for configure
	  and update of VERSION in configure.in
	- Show "file:line" when throwing a exception
	- Rewrote get_arch()

*eix-0.1.4 (2005/01/22)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added: multi-line entries in ebuild and/or /etc/make.conf are parsed
	  variables declared without double quotation marks are recognized correctly
	  as well as tab characters in PORTDIR_OVERLAY
	- Versions which are not tested on your architecture (arch not in KEYWORDS)
	  are now shown by default (previously: only with -v)
	  I changed the prefix for such versions from [M~] to [-]

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Cleaned the command line parser to use the quasi-standard getopts() which
	  is used by almost any Unix program.
	  eix -s is now default, so you can simply type "eix REGEXP" to search for packages.

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- added support for /etc/portage/categories

*eix-0.1.3 (2005/01/17)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed bug: multiple spaces in PORTDIR_OVERLAY (/etc/make.conf) were
	  interpreted as / overlays
	- Fixed: Version numbers should finally be sorted properly.
	  Explanation: In 0.1.2 versions were only splitted in [primary, e.g. |
	  1.2.3][suffix | _alpha5][gentoo-release | -r2]
	  Now, the primary string is also splitted into integers => 2.6.2 < 2.6.10
	- Added more detail to the error messages in version.cc (in hopes to
	  resolve kay's problem)

*eix-0.1.2 (2005/01/13)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Bekks removed the unnecessary libstdc++v3 dependency from the ebuild
	- The currently installed version of each package is now displayed again
	  Note: Slotted versions are still not supported
	- Corrected a bug of 0.1.0: All versions are displayed again
	- The -v parameter now also shows "arch masked" package versions, e.g. [M~]1.2.3-r4
	- Reverted to the old get_arch code because of an error on an amd64 system
	- Fixed a small bug in command-line parsing

*eix-0.1.0 (2005/01/09)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Renamed portagedb to eix
