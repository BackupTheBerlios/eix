- Full support for USE-Flags. If you plan to add this support, note that
  eix already reads the IUSE data for each version if you undefine
  NOT_FULL_USE in portage/version.h (see the comments there!).

- Talk with portage people to support portage-2.1* cache method fully
  (however, I guess currently there are no plans to support any cache
  except sqlite).
