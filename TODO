Things to do perhaps:
- Support virtuals in sets: This would require to store the sets for virtuals
  in every Version (and to backup it for the various settings).
  It is lot of work to implement, costs lot of memory and also lot of
  execution time.  Hence, this will have to wait until the portage tree or
  some important overlays make excessive use of it - which is hopefully never.

Ambitious tasks which will probably not be realized:
- Support for Paludis.
  Would require rather different mask/keywords handling,
  in particular in connected with option -T and with overlays;
  Probably a separated mask handling would have to be implemented to let -T
  still work.  Moreover, overlay handling - especially for /var/db/pkg -
  would have to be completely rewritten and in a way which would probably
  exclude CAREMODE=false and break compatibility with older portage versions
  which did not store repo_name in /var/db/pkg. On the other hand, the current
  implementation of these things is a mess anyway, but even users of new
  portage versions might still have entries without repo_name in /var/db/pkg.
  Moreover, CAREMODE=false is really important for the speed in typical,
  i.e. occasional, usage of eix.
- Full support for USE-Flags.
  Although initial implementation is not
  extremely hard, it would require permanent updates, since frequently
  new and different ways for configuration had been introduced in the
  previous years, and it does not seem that this will ever reach a "final"
  state. So I simply refuse to maintain it.
